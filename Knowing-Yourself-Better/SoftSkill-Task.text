Self-reflection on Friday's activities.

Friday was a day full of learning and self-discovery. I had the opportunity to delve into new topics and skills that significantly broadened my understanding. One of the key takeaways was the importance of effective communication in both individual and group settings. Learning how to articulate my thoughts clearly and listening actively to others has already started to impact my interactions positively. Additionally, I was introduced the importance of self-Awareness and Johari Window, understanding Strenghts and wearknesses and also Practical tips for self-Improvement. those topics provided me with a structured way to understand my personal traits, both those that are visible to others and those that are not. This exercise helped me identify areas where I excel and aspects where I need improvement.
Working with friends in the group was a rewarding experience. Each member brought unique strengths to the table. unfortunately i do not remember all of their names. Mr naqawe's ability to communicate complex ideas in a simple manner ensured everyone in the group was on the same page.
